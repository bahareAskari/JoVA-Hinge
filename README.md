Joint-Variational-Autoencoders-for-Recommendation-with-Implicit-Feedback:


# Introduction
Joint variational autoencoder (JoVA) is a top-k  recommendor system with  implicit  feedback.  JoVA, as  an  ensemble  of  two  VAES,  simultaneously  and  jointly learns  user-user  and  item-item  correlations.  A  variant  of JoVA, referred to as JoVA-Hinge, includes pairwise ranking loss in addition to VAE’s losses to specialize JoVA further for recommendation with implicit feedback.
